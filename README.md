# BLACKJACK (sf333)

## Overview
This Android app is a Tic Tac Toe game developed using the Kotlin programming language and Jetpack Compose. Blackjack is a popular card game played in casinos worldwide. The primary objective is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it

## Basics:
Players: Typically, the game involves multiple players against the dealer.
Deck: It's usually played with one to eight standard decks of 52 cards.
Card Values: Numbered cards are worth their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11, depending on the player's choice.

## Gameplay:
Deal: Players place bets, and the dealer deals two cards to each player, including themselves. One of the dealer's cards is face-up, while the other is face-down (hole card).
Player's Turn: Players decide to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
Dealer's Turn: After all players complete their turns, the dealer reveals their hole card. The dealer typically hits until reaching a total of 17 or higher.
Winning: Players win if their hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's without going over 21 (busting). A "blackjack" (an Ace plus a 10-value card) usually pays out more than a standard win.

## Key Terms:
Hit: To request another card.
Stand: To keep the current hand and end the turn.
Double Down: Some variants allow players to double their initial bet after receiving the first two cards but restrict them to receiving only one more card.
Split: When a player's first two cards have the same value, they can split them into separate hands and play each hand separately.
Insurance: When the dealer's face-up card is an Ace, players may place an insurance bet against the dealer having a blackjack.

## Winning Scenarios:
Win: Beating the dealer's hand without going over 21.
Push: Having the same hand value as the dealer results in a tie, and the player's bet is returned.
Bust: Going over 21, resulting in an automatic loss.
